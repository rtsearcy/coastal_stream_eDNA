fish_trap.csv
All fish handling records proximate to the Scott Creek weir. Includes data from the adult trap (weir) and the smelt trap (upstream). Record from 1/8/2019 to 5/21/2020 [N=8974 records] (wildfires occurred soon thereafter, but some counts from 6/1/2020 and 10/21/2020). Majority (92%) of records from smolt trap
Variables:
site - site of trap/capture 
species - coho, trout, or undetermined
origin - natural, hatchery, or capture (for broodstock)
sex - male, female, undetermined
life_stage - life stage of capture fish
live_adult - if adult, was the fish alive?
length - body length (mm)
mass - body mass (g)
body_depth - body depth (cm)
Other vars: latitude, longitude, id, event, condition_code, notes  


weir_wtemp.csv
15 min water temperature at the Scott Creek Weir. Temperature (in Celsius) recorded using a Hobo data logger. Record from 1/1/2019 - 12/2/2020. No missing data


lagoon_wq.csv
15m water quality data collected from the Scott Creek lagoon. Record from 1/1/2019 to 8/21/20. 
No data from 7/6/2019-7/24/2019, 10/15/2019-10/16/2019, 11/16/2019-12/9/2019, 3/11/2020-4/3/2020 (71 days total). 
Variables:
wtemp - water temperature (Celsius)
pH - pH
depth - water depth (m)
sp_cond - specific conductance (microS/cm)
turb - turbidity (NTU, assumed)
DO - dissolved oxygen (mg/L)
DO% - dissolved oxygen %. 


hatchery_releases.csv
Coho smolt and parr release counts by the Monterey Bay Trout and Salmon Project between 1/1/2019 and 8/15/2020 (N=12 releases).
Note: release numbers differ from log received in early 2020 (see old files). Seem to be biomass based (not integers).

Big Creek	BC	37.07457	-122.221611	Big Creek adjacent to Kingfisher Flat hatchery				



Old files:
ScottCreek_TrapSummary_WY2019.xlsx
Contains weir and smolt trap daily capture data for water year 2019. The adult trap operated (occasionally intermittently due to storm events) from Jan 5 through May 31, 2019, whereas the downstream migrant (smolt) trap operated primarily from April 16 through May 31.

ScottCreek_WY2019_GageData_191206.xlsx
Contains temperature and stage data collected by Cal Poly. We identified some QA/QC issues with the stage data that we were not able to resolve satisfactorily.  More comprehensive water quality information (e.g., pH, Conductance, turbidity, DO) is available from the NOAA sonde located in the estuary - about 700 m below the weir.
